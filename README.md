## Tag UI for Symphony: Selector

Selector provides a search and select interface for Symphony tag lists.

### Installation

1. Upload Selector to your `extensions` folder.
2. Enable Selector in the backend.
3. Add a standard tag field to your section.

Please keep in mind that interface only uses existing values. At this point it does not support mixed suggestions. For section based suggestions use the standard Associations UI: Selector

### Acknowledgement

The interface of Selector is based on [Selectize by Brian Reavis](https://github.com/brianreavis/selectize.js) bundled with the Symphony core and the work done by Nils & Hana HÃ¶rrmann on the [Associations UI: Selector](https://github.com/hananils/association_ui_selector).
